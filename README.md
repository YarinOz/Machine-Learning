# Machine Learning assignments

Machine Learning Assignments i did as part of a course called Introduction to ML.
The course covered subjects like statistical models (SVM's, logistic regression, etc), neural netwroks (Random forests, CNN's, RNN's, Transformers, etc) and generative models based on neural networks like GAN's and Autoencoders.

## This repo. contain 3 assignments over Jupyter-Notebook:
1. Statistical models and feature extraction
2. 1-Layer netwrok using sigmoid activation over cross-entropy loss
3. Multi-Layered network based on CNN architecture
